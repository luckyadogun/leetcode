def dividetwointegers(dividend, divisor):
    """
    Given two integers - dividend and divisor,
    divide both without using arithmetic operators (+,-,*,/, %)
    return the quotient after dividing dividend by divisor

    Questions?
        0. Can the integers be negative? YES
        1. What happens when the integers are negative? Nothing
        2. What's quotient? What remainds after we divide two numbers
        3. IF
            dividend/divisor = x
            return quotient of x

    SET A
    -----
    dividend = 100
    divisor = 2
    x = 50

    SET B
    ------
    dividend = 10
    divisor = 3
    x = 3 (Floor of the quotient)
